\section{Field}
The game consists of a field.
This field determines the size of the field in the Game of Life.
In turn, I have also removed the resize feature of the original Game of Life implementation.
An unfortunate consequence of this decision is that the GameofLife.java also needs to be generated.
I could have also chosen to rewite substantial parts of GameofLife.java, but that would have costed me too much time.

\section{Natural Language}
I tried to get as close to natural language as possible in my rules, with some structure.
I thought this might allow people who are very foreign to structures language models to still use the DSL.
